"One evening, two months after your marriage, you and your wife decide to invite your parents to dinner at your apartment. This is the first time you have invited any of them over for dinner, worried about revealing your shaky culinary skills. You had planned to make lasagna and asked a good friend for a trusted recipe. She had written it out on an index card, and you had painstakingly followed each step. When the lasagna seems ready to serve, you proudly bring it to the table. After the six of you admire it for a minute, you start to cut the first piece, only to realize that you can't get a knife into it. Your friend had neglected to write down that the noodles should be boiled first, so they are uncooked and have petrified in the pan.
